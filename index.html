    <h1>Here are my 5 Milestones</h1>
    <ul> <b>
<li>iPhone sales break 1 million</li></b>
<p>January of 2007 Steve Jobs announced the <i>iPhone</i> at the Macworld event. He said that it was <br>
"an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator" all in one, he said that it would 'make history'.  
There were alot of people who didn't agree with his statement and thought that the device would go no where. It was dimissed by the CEOs of RIM, Palm, and the maker of the BlackBerry phones.
Steve Ballmer - Microsoft CEO- said,<br> "There's no chance that the <i>iPhone</i> is going to get any significant share. No chance."</p>
<p>Boy were they wrong when Apple sold around 270,000 units, in just the US with only one operator partner (AT&T).<br> Then on September 10th when Apple announced it had sold its 1 millionth phone.
Jobs said, "1m iPhones in 74 days, It took almost two years to <br>achieve this <i>milestone</i> with iPod." This was probably the biggest or one of the biggest milestones for the <i>iPhone</i>.<br>
Other than well the creation of the <i>iPhone</i>.
<p>By the time the original iPhone was discontinued around June of 2008, Apple had sold a total of over 6 million units of the original model.</p>

<li>Hey Siri</li></b>
<p>On October 4th of 2011 the iPhone 4S was enveiled at the "Let's Talk iPhone" event. With a new feature <i>'Siri'</i>, a virtual assistant who could process <br>
    and do what the user commanded and the command did not have to be typed in. You could simply just say the command out loud.</p>
    <p>Before it was announced that <i>Siri</i> would be on the iPhone 4S. Not alot of people were interested in the new iPhone. It was masked by the death of the CEO Steve Jobs. <br>
    Jobs stepped down as CEO in August of 2011 because of illness. His death was annouced the day after Apple's big reveal of the iPhone 4S. <br>
    However, the annoucement of Siri caught the attention of many many users.</p>
<p>While <i>'Siri'</i> wasnt perfect she captured the public imagination. Plus she could be considered one Apple's biggest milestones.</p>
<b>
<li>iPhone in China</li></b>
<p>I don't know if you know this but it has always been hard to open up China's trading ports and to be able to sell things that were made in places other than China its self. <br>
So you can just imagine how happy Apple was when the iPhone entered China. So many more users and customers, I mean this was a huge milestone for them. Anyways....</p>
<p>After many many years of negotiation, its was annouced by Apple December of 2013 that they had finally signed an agreement with China Mobile.<br>
 China Telecom and China Unicom also signed their own deal with Apple that very same year. On January 17 of 2014, the iPhone 5S and 5C were sold through<br>
China Mobile. China Mobile remains to be the largest mobile network. Tim Cook said back in 2014, "China is an extremely important market for Apple.", and he was right. <br>
Apple had 760 million subscribers at the time. The first quarter after the launch Greater China was Apple’s third biggest market, bringing revenues of $9.3bn. Thats alot of money <br>
no wonder this is a milestone.</p>
<b>
<li>Apple Pay</li></b>
<p>In October of 2014, <i>Apple Pay</i> was announced. iPhone 6 and Apple Watch owners would now be able to use their device to pay for everyday items. <br>
Tim Cook said that <i>Apple Pay</i> was going to change all of the struggles of a credit/ debit card. Here's how it works or worked then: add a credit card from your iTunes <br>
account or add a new one with the phone's iSight camera. Once the card is on file with <i>Apple Pay</i>, you can use your phone to see what vendors are participating with it by <br>
authenticating with Touch ID. Of course now (2021) there have probably been more updates and probably runs much more quickly and effecient now.</p>
<p>Apple announced a slew of partners for <i>Apple Pay</i>, including McDonalds, Wallgreens, Uber, Panera, Subway, Disney, Sephora, Macy's, and of course Apple's 258 retail stores.</p>
<p>By January of 2015, Cook announced that <i>Apple Pay</i> accounted for more than $2 out of every $3 that were spent through Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. <br>
By the end of 2016 it was supported by 35 percent of all US merchants.

<b>
<li>iPhone sales drop</li></b>
<p>In October of 2016, Apple had experienced its first annual decline in revenue since 2001. The revenue fell from $244.7 billion in 2015 to $217 billion in 2016,<br>
an 8 percent decrease. The fall was primarily down to the declining sales of Apple's most important product the iPhone. While they were still selling a lot of iPhones <br>
that quarter had a 5 percent decrease from the previous quarter. Despite the decline in sales and profits, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “Our strong September <br>
quarter results cap a very successful fiscal 2016 for Apple. We’re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2.”
</p>
<p>In July of 2016, just after the first drop was reported, Apple sold its billionth phone.
